<h1>Fair Deal Memo</h1>
<p class="lede">A short document to make expectations explicitâ€”before work begins.</p><p>This memo is grounded in the idea that many downstream conflicts originate in how agreements begin.</p>
<p class="muted">
      The Fair Deal Memo is a lightweight way to apply the Fair Deal Policy (FDP) in real collaborations.
      It is not a contract. It does not replace legal agreements. It exists to create clarity early.
    </p>
<h2>When to use a Fair Deal Memo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting a new collaboration</li>
<li>Working with a new partner or client</li>
<li>Entering a short project or gig</li>
<li>Forming a consortium or partnership</li>
<li>When expectations or power dynamics are unclear</li>
<li>When purpose integrity matters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="callout">
<p style="margin:0;">
        Keep it human-scale. 1â€“2 pages is usually enough. Plain language beats legal language. Ambiguity is a signalâ€”clarify it early.
      </p>
</div>
<h2>Use with LinkedIn and proposals</h2>
<p class="muted">
      Share this page link when proposing collaboration. It normalizes clarity without escalation:
      â€œBefore we proceed, I suggest we align using a short Fair Deal Memo.â€
