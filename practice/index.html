      <strong>Pilot A:</strong> Making fairness explicit before collaboration begins. Participants use a short Fair Deal Memo

    <h2>Kickoff agenda (copy)</h2>
    <div class="copyrow">

      <button class="btn btn-primary" data-copy="#kickoff">Copy</button>
    </div>
    <pre><code id="kickoff">PILOT A — KICKOFF AGENDA (60 MIN)

Purpose
- Establish psychological safety
- Align on why the pilot exists
- Normalize disagreement and fair exit

0–10 min — Opening & framing
- Voluntary participation; no attribution without consent
- Not a contract; not compliance; not judgment

10–20 min — Round: what usually goes wrong too late?
- 1–2 minutes per person

20–35 min — Walkthrough: Fair Deal Memo v1
- Purpose, contributions, value exchange, power, risks, exit

35–45 min — Guardrails
- Early exit is a valid outcome
- “We don’t know yet” is acceptable

45–55 min — Next steps
- Which collaboration will use a memo; who drafts first; review trigger

55–60 min — Close
- One word: how you feel entering this pilot</code></pre>

    <h2>Reflection template (copy)</h2>
    <div class="copyrow">
      <div class="label">Pilot A reflection template (copy all)</div>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" data-copy="#reflect">Copy</button>
    </div>
    <pre><code id="reflect">PILOT A — REFLECTION (PRIVATE BY DEFAULT)

1) Context
- What collaboration did you use the memo for?
- At what stage was the memo introduced?

2) What the memo clarified early
- Which assumptions became visible?
- What conversations happened sooner than usual?

3) Where the memo was insufficient
- What remained ambiguous?
- What still surprised you later?

4) Impact on decisions
- Did the memo change whether/how the collaboration proceeded?
- Did anyone opt out earlier than they otherwise would have?

5) Power & fairness
- Did making power explicit change behavior?
- Were asymmetries reduced or simply surfaced?

6) Emotional & cognitive effects
- Did clarity reduce stress or increase it?
- Did it make saying “no” easier?

7) What you would change
- What would you add/remove/rephrase?

8) One sentence takeaway
- “Using a Fair Deal Memo changed this collaboration by…”</code></pre>

    <h2>Public synthesis format (copy)</h2>

      <button class="btn btn-primary" data-copy="#synthesis">Copy</button>

    <pre><code id="synthesis">PILOT A — PUBLIC SYNTHESIS (PATTERNS, NOT ATTRIBUTION)

Title
- Making Fairness Explicit Before Collaboration Begins: What We Learned

Include (briefly)
- Why we ran the pilot
- What we did (high level)
- What became clear earlier than usual
- What the memo helped with most
- Where it was insufficient
- Effects on power & fairness (mixed is OK)
- What we would change next time
- What this does not prove
- Next steps</code></pre>

    <h2>Share experience (voluntary)</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      If you used FDP in any context—Open Collective, LinkedIn, proposals, teams—share what happened:
      what it clarified, where it failed, and what was missing. This is how FDP stays portable and improves.
