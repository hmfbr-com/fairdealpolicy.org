# FDP Template Skeleton v1.0
## Canonical Commitment Grammar for Fair-Deal Policies

**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Stability expectation:** High (slow-moving)  
**Change scope:** Structural only (no domain-specific content)

---

## 0. Purpose and Role

This document defines the **minimum required structural grammar** for any template, agreement, policy, charter, or framework that claims alignment with the **Fair Deal Policy (FDP)**.

It does **not** define:
- specific rules,
- domain-specific norms,
- or enforcement outcomes.

It **does** define:
- how commitments must be *constructed*,
- how power and asymmetry must be surfaced *before commitment*,
- how fairness is anchored to invariant principles while allowing local adaptation.

---

## 1. Position in the FDP Architecture

This Skeleton sits between:

- **FDP Spine (10 Articles)** → normative invariants  
- **Templates** → situated, domain-specific instantiations

Relationship:

> Spine constrains → Skeleton structures → Templates instantiate

Templates that do not conform to this Skeleton **cannot** claim FDP compatibility.

---

## 2. Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All FDP-compatible templates MUST:

1. Make **power asymmetries explicit**
2. Apply **fairness considerations before commitment**, not only after
3. Distinguish clearly between principles, actors, processes, and evolution
4. Enable **traceable evolution** without retroactive ambiguity
5. Prefer **constraint clarity** over aspirational language

---

## 3. Required Blocks (Canonical Grammar)

Every FDP-compatible template MUST contain the following blocks, in order.

### Block 0 — Identification & Versioning

**Required elements:**
- Template name
- Template family (if applicable)
- Skeleton version referenced
- Template version
- Date of issuance
- Intended scope of application
- Explicit references to relevant FDP Articles

---

### Block 1 — Principles & Constraints

**Required elements:**
- FDP Articles explicitly referenced
- Non-negotiable principles
- Declared fairness assumptions
- Explicit exclusions (what this template does *not* govern)

**Constraint:** This block MUST NOT contain operational procedures.

---

### Block 2 — Actors, Scope & Power Surfaces

**Required elements:**
- Defined actors and roles
- Rights and responsibilities per actor
- Declared power asymmetries
- Resource, data, or decision control points
- Entry and exit conditions

---

### Block 3 — Outset Design (Pre-Commit Lens)

**Required elements:**
- Mandatory pre-commit questions
- Disclosure requirements
- Decision thresholds
- Red-flag or no-go conditions
- References to applicable FDP Outset formulas (if used)

**Constraint:** If this block is absent or superficial, FDP alignment is invalid.

---

### Block 4 — Governance, Dispute & Correction

**Required elements:**
- Governance mechanism
- Dispute resolution process
- Escalation paths
- Correction and remediation logic
- Abuse and misuse handling

---

### Block 5 — Review, Learning & Evolution

**Required elements:**
- Review cadence
- Feedback incorporation method
- Update rules for the template
- Relationship to Skeleton updates
- Conditions for deprecation or sunset

---

## 4. Validity Conditions

A template is **FDP-compatible** if and only if:

- All required blocks are present
- Each block fulfills its stated purpose
- FDP Article references are explicit
- Outset Design is substantively applied
- Versioning is unambiguous

---

## 5. Evolution Rules

- **Skeleton versioning:** MAJOR = structural changes (rare); MINOR = clarifications  
- **Template versioning:** independent, but must reference Skeleton version used

---

## 6. What This Skeleton Intentionally Does Not Do

- It does not define fairness outcomes
- It does not prescribe enforcement bodies
- It does not privilege any sector or ideology
- It does not prevent alternative standards from existing

It defines **conditions for coherence**, not dominance.
